- **Primary Asset:** BTC/USD
- **Trading Style:** Multi-timeframe ICT (Smart Money Concepts)

## 🎯 TRADING METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: 4H Analysis (Bias & Direction)
**Objective:** Identify main trend and institutional levels

1. **Trend Identification**
   - Follow 4H market structure (Higher Highs/Higher Lows OR Lower Highs/Lower Lows)
   - Direction = Trend direction on 4H

2. **Mark Key Levels**
   - Order Blocks (OBs): Last bullish/bearish candle before strong move
   - Fair Value Gaps (FVGs): 3-candle imbalance zones
   - Liquidity pools: Equal highs/lows, round numbers

3. **Decision Point**
   - Wait for price to reach 4H POI (OB or FVG)
   - THEN move to 15min timeframe

---

### Phase 2: 15min Confirmation (Entry Setup)
**Objective:** Confirm reversal at 4H POI

1. **Wait for CHoCH (Change of Character)**
   - Bullish CHoCH: Break of previous lower high (in downtrend)
   - Bearish CHoCH: Break of previous higher low (in uptrend)
   - This confirms institutional interest at the 4H POI

2. **Mark 15min Levels**
   - Identify new OBs after CHoCH
   - Mark FVGs created during the CHoCH move
   - Note: These become your 15min POIs

3. **Decision Point**
   - Wait for price to retrace to 15min POI
   - THEN move to 1min timeframe

---

### Phase 3: 1min Execution (Precise Entry)
**Objective:** Execute trade with optimal entry

1. **Wait for 1min CHoCH**
   - Confirms strength at 15min POI
   - Shows short-term momentum shift

2. **Identify 1min POIs**
   - Order Blocks in 1min
   - Fair Value Gaps in 1min
   - Fibonacci levels (0.618, 0.786 golden ratios)

3. **Entry Execution** 
   - If it can identify a single POI clearly, use it to enter. 
   - If there are many POIs (FVG + OB), Enter when price touches Golden Pocket.
   - No additional confirmation needed (direct entry)
   - Multiple entries allowed across different 1min POIs (Because of 1 min most of the timme trades can be lost)   ???
   - If one trade loss then wait for another BOS or CHOCH in 15 min.  ???

---

## 🎲 POSITION MANAGEMENT

### Entry Rules
- **Multiple Positions:** Yes, across different 1min POIs (OB, FVG, Fib levels)  ???
- **Entry Type:** Market/Limit order at exact Golden Pocket/POI touch
- **Position Sizing:** Calculate based on stop loss distance

### Special Entries
- After BOS when 15 CHOCH has confirmed. 
- MArk 15 min POIs (FVGs and OBs)
- After price reache it, go to 1 min and do the same thing.
- TP: 15 min liquidity area. Not 4H target. ???

**Position Size Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Account × Risk%) / Stop Loss Distance in $
```

### Stop Loss Placement
**Primary Rule:** Upper/lower boundary of 1min swing.
**Alternative Rule:** Nearest 1min swing high/low (if market is choppy)

⚠️ **Important:** Adjust position size if using wider SL

### Take Profit Strategy
**Primary Target:** Opposite 4H POI or major liquidity level. Based on the power of POI and trend direction.

**Secondary Adjustments:**
- If 15min shows new resistance/support → Consider partial TP
- If momentum weakens → Trail stop or manual exit
- Watch for 15min CHoCH against your position

**Break-Even Rule:**
- At 1:5 R:R → Move stop loss to entry on 50% of position
- Let remaining 50% run to full 4H target

### Risk-Reward Expectations
- **Target R:R:** 1:25+ (based on 4H targets)
- **Expected Win Rate:** 30-40% (acceptable with high R:R)
- **Implication:** Expect 6-7 losses for every 3-4 wins
- **Psychology:** Losses are normal and expected with this strategy

## 🧠 PSYCHOLOGY & DISCIPLINE

### Mental Rules:
1. **Accept losses as business costs** - With 1:25 R:R, 60-70% loss rate is normal
2. **Trust the process** - Don't abandon strategy after 3-4 losses
3. **One setup at a time** - Don't force trades outside your system
4. **Journal everything** - Your data is your teacher

### Red Flags (Stop Trading):
- 3 consecutive losses in one session → Stop for the day
- Feeling emotional (angry, desperate) → Close platform
- Deviating from plan → Review plan, don't trade
- Account down 10% in a week → Review entire strategy

### Green Flags (Keep Trading):
- Following plan exactly, regardless of outcome
- Losing trades that were "perfect setups"
- Patient waiting for all confirmations
- Proper position sizing every time

---

## 📈 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### Weekly Review (Every Sunday):
1. Review all trades in journal
2. Calculate: Win rate, Average R:R, Profit Factor
3. Identify pattern: Which timeframe had errors?
4. Update plan if consistent issue found

### Monthly Review:
1. Are you profitable? If not, why?
2. Is win rate within expected range (30-40%)?
3. Are losses controlled (max 1-2% per trade)?
4. Psychology check: Are you following plan?

### What to Track:
- Best performing 1min POI type (OB vs FVG vs Fib)
- Best trading hours
- Impact of news trading
- Emotional state vs outcome

---

## ⚠️ RISK WARNINGS

1. **Small Account Reality:** $100 account limits position sizes significantly. With $1-2 risk, some trades may be too small for minimum lot sizes.

2. **High R:R = Low Win Rate:** Be prepared for strings of 5-10 losses. This is mathematically normal.

3. **Multiple Entries Risk:** If 4H POI fails completely, all 1min entries will likely fail. Don't risk more than 2% total across all entries in same zone.

4. **Overtrading Danger:** With multiple entries allowed, track total daily risk. Don't exceed 6% total risk per day.
